                <h2>importance of engineering drawing</h2>
            <div class="kk"><p>As means of communication.
                As the idea becomes technical the usual means of communication (talk or listen, read or write) will be less exact. For this reason visual language is developed to be technical and accurate means communication. This visual language in broad term is called graphic language. 
                As an engineering drawing displays the exact picture of an object, it obviously conveys the same ideas to every trained eye. Irrespective of language barriers, the drawings can be effectively used in other countries,
                Thus, the engineering drawing is the universal language of all engineers.
                </p></div></div>

           <h2>Composition of Graphic Language</h2>
            <div class="kk"><p>Graphic language in  “engineering application”   use lines  to represent the surfaces,  edges  and contours of objects.
                This language is known as  “drawing”  or  “drafting”
                A drawing can be done by freehand,  or using instruments or computer  methods.
                </p></div></div>

            <h2>Principles in engineering drawing</h2>
            <div class="kk"><p>There are two principles in drawing
                Visualization
                      The ability to see what an object looks like in the mind of eye.
                Implementation
                       Drawing of an object that has been visualized.

            <h2>Types of technical drawing
            </h2>
            <div class="kk"><p>Technical drawing must communicate the same message to every user or reader of the drawing, whereas an artistic drawing is usually interpreted differently by everyone who sees it. <br> 
                Engineers: People who use technical means to solve problems. They design products, systems, devices, and structures to improve our living conditions. </p></div></div>
            <h2>History of Engineering Drawing</h2>
            <div class="kk"><p>Drawing is one of the oldest forms of communication, dating back even further than the verbal communication.
                Historically drawing is started by the caveman. <br>
                He uses it for communication to lead his day to day life.
                Egyptian hieroglyphics also play its own role for the development of drawing. 
                 Leonardo da Vinci prepared mechanical drawings showing orthographic views as we do now. <br>
                 As human needs increase continuously, there is revolutionary change. Industrial revolution is one of the milestones for the development of drawing. 
                From time to time several rules and principles are developed to utilize drawing as efficient as possible. 
                It is about 1749 that, the drawing with the current conventional representations came into existence by Washington DC civil engineers.
 
                </p></div></div>

            <div class="kk"><p>Sketch: made without drawing tools... Just pencil and paper.  Scale is approximate, not accurate, but the sketch should still look like the object.





                Engineering Drawing: Made with drawing tools... Ruler, set squares, protractor and compass.  Scale should be accurate and the drawing should be prepared carefully.
                </p></div></div>
                <h2>Drawing paper:
                </h2>
            <div class="kk"><p>The following elements to be noticed over the format of our drawing paper:
                Border line: it is the peripheral heaviest lines which enclose all drawings.
                Title Block: It is a box where all information about the drawing such as drawn by, checked by, date, scale, title of drawing, drawing number and company name are specified. 
                Guide line: is the lightest line used to guide the height of alphabets. <br>Drawing  Scales  
                Scale: is a ratio between the linear dimension(size) of a drawn representation of an object and the actual object. 
                
                </p></div></div>

            <div class="kk"><p>Designation of a scale consists of the word “SCALE” followed by the indication of its ratio, as follows.
                <br>SCALE 1:1	           for full size<br>
               
                SCALE X:1           (X > 1) for an enlargement  scale <br>

                <h2>Drawing instruments and their use
                </h2>
            <div class="kk"><p>The preparation of technical drawing is possible only through knowledge and skill in the use of a variety of instruments.
                With the aid of knowledge and skill practice it is possible to bring perfection!
                <br>Drawing board is made from strips of well seasoned soft wood generally 25 mm thick. One of the shorter edges of the rectangular board is provided with perfectly straight ebony edge which is used as working edge on which the T-square is moved while making Drawings.
                <br>Selection of drawing pencil 
                type and quality of drawing paper 
                how thick and dark you want the line to be. 
                Pencil lines should be clean and sharp. They must be dark enough for the views to be seen when the standard lines are drawn. 
                If you use too much pressure, you will groove the drawing surface. You can avoid this if you use proper grade of lead.
                Turn the pencil between your thumb and forefinger as you draw a line.
                
                

            </p></div></div>
            <h2>T-square </h2>
            <div class="kk"><p>They can be made from different materials, mostly wood or plastic. 
                parts: blade and head
               The head is fixed at 900 to the blade.
               The head is made to slide along the working edge and the Blade moves on the Drawing board. Used for  Drawing horizontal lines, Guiding triangles, Position drawing paper
               The cleanness of your T –square greatly affect your drawing quality and cleanliness. 
               </p></div></div>
               <h2>Set square </h2>
            <div class="kk"><p>Set squares are generally made from Plastic or celluloid material. They are triangular in shape with one corner, a right angle triangle. A pair of set squares (30°–60°) and 45° (45° set square are generally provided with Protractor) facilitate marking of angles.
                They are used to draw lines at 30°, 60° and 45° to the vertical and horizontal
                
                <br>Protractors are used to mark or measure angles between 0 and 180°. They are semicircular in shape (of diameter 100mm) and are made of Plastic or celluloid which has more life.

                Protractors with circular shape capable of marking and measuring 0 to 360° are also available in the market.
                </p></div></div>
                <h2>Drawing Instrument Box  </h2>
            <div class="kk"><p>It consists of the following <br>
                a)  Large size compasses,<br>
                b)  Large size divider,<br>
                c)  Small size bow pen, bow divider, and <br>
                d)  Lengthening bar.
                <img src="https://media.istockphoto.com/id/1448170573/photo/architectural-project.webp?b=1&s=170667a&w=0&k=20&c=p6Y94nGDNjCX4HKzFQxN37DvRlMsN5QxQi1uP4F4kbA=" alt="">
                Compass is used for drawing circles and arcs of circles. The compass has two legs hinged at one end. One of the legs has a pointed needle fitted at the lower end where as the other end has provision for inserting pencil lead. Circles up to 120mm diameters are drawn by keeping the legs of compass straight. For drawing circles more than 150 mm radius, a lengthening bar is used.

It is advisable to keep the needle end about 1mm long compared to that of pencil end so that while drawing circles, when the needle end is pressed it goes inside the drawing sheet by a small distance (approximately 1mm).
</p></div></div>
            <h2>Divider </h2>

            <div class="kk"><p>A divider is a drawing instrument used for dividing distances into equal parts or for laying off a series of equal spaces. 
            </p></div></div>
            <h2>French Curve </h2>
            <div class="kk"><p>When it is required to draw mechanical curves other than circles or circular arcs, a French curve is generally employed. Many different forms and sizes of French curves are manufactured, as suggested by the more common forms. The curves are composed largely of successive segments of the geometric curves, as the ellipse, parabola, hyperbola, involutes, etc. 
            </p></div></div>
            <h2>Lettering
            </h2>
            <div class="kk"><p>Lettering is used on drawings to give dimensions and other pertinent information needed to fully describe the item. To communicate nongraphic information.
                The lettering must be neat and legible in order to be easily read and understood <br>Use a single stroke Gothic text style, either inclined or vertical.
              <br>Space between lines
              of text is at least 1/3
              of text height.
              Most of the time it is recommended to use 3mm height of letters to write in the title block except title of the drawing which is slightly larger than the others, 5mm. 
Between lines of sentences we use a gap of about 3/5th of the height of letters. 
All words in title blocks should be written in upper case letters.


            </p></div></div>
            <h2>Dimensions in engineering drawing </h2>
            <div class="kk"><p>Dimension is for size and position (of the designed/modeled shape). 
                A dimension is a numerical value expressed in appropriate units of measurement and used to define the size, location, orientation, form or other geometric characteristics of a part.
