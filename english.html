            <h2>Lesson1:Definition and types  of a sentence</h2>
        <div class="kk"><p>What is a sentence to you? 
            What are components of sentence?
           Which of the following groups of words can be a sentence?  
           Early in the morning.
           I am learning English.
           My father works in Adama.
           When I arrived at bus station.  
           Stop!
           When we speak or write we use words. Words can be 
Functional (grammatical) words  like  articles (a, an, or the), conjunctions (because, while, and, but, or so),  prepositions (in, to, of, etc.), and other words whose function is primarily to express relationships among other words.
Content Words:  noun, pronoun, adjective, verb and adverb whose function is mainly to convey meanings.
We express our thoughts or feeling using words in groups.
</p></div>
        <div class="kk"><p>Sentence is a group of words that has complete thought. 
            It begins with a capital letter and ends with a period, a question mark, or an exclamation point. 
            Here are examples.
            1. He has opened the door.                              
            2. Has he opened the door? 
             3.  How noisily he has opened the door!
            4. Open the door.  
            5. Stop!
            
            </p></div>
            <h2>1. 2 Parts  of a sentence</h2>
        <div class="kk"><p>A sentence must:
            identify what or whom you’re talking about
            say something about that person, thing, or abstract concept.
            e.g.  Almaz  ran to the door. 
            Here, we’re talking about(Almaz ) and  a statement about her (what she did). 
            These two parts are, known as the subject and the predicate respectively. 
            
            </p></div>
        <div class="kk"><p>The subject is the who or the what that a sentence is referring to. It might be one or more words.  Note examples of  subjects in boldface:
            S1. He got a sweater for Christmas.
            S2. The sweater he got for Christmas was too small for him.
            S3.The idea that he would get yet another sweater next Christmas frustrated him 
            S4. Joseph and John got a sweater for Christmas.
            </p></div>
        <div class="kk"><p>
        <
        The predicate is the part of the sentence that contains the verb and every other word in the sentence that’s not the subject. 
                It  might be only one word (the verb) or it might be a several group of words.
                E.g.1. I will go to Austria as soon as the rates get better. 
                Notice that every single word in the sentence belongs to either the subject or the predicate
                . Identify  the subject and predicate of the given sentences. 
                <br>1. He writes.<br> 
                2. Dana’s father went into the hospital yesterday. <br>
                3. The television in the den doesn’t work. <br>
              II. First, individually write  three sentences of your own, and indicate their  subjects and the predicates. Then you will write it on white board for the whole class in turn.

        <h1>Session 2: types of sentences</h1>
        <h2> Sentences    Types: Functional Classification</h2>
        <div class="kk"><p>Sentences  are structurally ( the number and types of clauses) classified into four types:
            <br>simple Sentence <br>
            compound Sentence, <br>
           complex Sentence, and <br>
            compound-complex Sentence <br>
            compound-complex Sentence <br>Brainstorming questions
            What is simple sentence? 
            How many clauses do it contain? 
            
            Simple Sentence is a kind of sentence which has at least a subject and a verb (one main clause(MC)). 
            A sentence can get quite long and complicated and still remain a simple sentence. 
            Note that, however, there is no dependent clause and no more than one independent (main clause)  clause in a simple sentence. 
            
           </p></div>
        <div class="kk"><p>The loin came.  (a MC with single subject and single verb)
            Tiger and lion are cat families. (a MC with compound subject)
            Teachers read and teach.  (a MC with compound verb)
            My father and mother said goodbye and left on the vacation. (a MC with compound verb and compound subject)
            He opened the letter and the box. (a MC with compound direct object)
            It can rain from the east or from the west. (Compound prepositional phrase)
             Mary writes me letters (a MC with compound object: the direct object letters and the indirect object me)
            </p></div>
            <h2>II. Compound Sentences</h2>
        <div class="kk"><p>Brainstorming questions
            What is compound sentence? 
            How many clauses do it contain? 
            It has only been a week,  and I feel lonesome without you. 
This hill is small, but it is perfect  for sledding.  
Kaleab is not feeling well, yet he is going to work this morning anyway. 
I am running shortage of money, so I am going to have some per time job.
Consumers demand, manufacturers supply, and the cycle continues. 
Question: Construct five similar sentences of your own.  

            
         Compound Sentence has two or more independent clauses; in other words, it is a group of two or more simple sentences</p></div>
         <h2>Compound</h2>
        <div class="kk"><p>a compound sentence never contains subordinate clause. 
            usually  compound sentences are made by the strategy of sentences combining called coordination. 
           In coordination we use coordinating conjunction  ( and, but, so, for, yet, or, nor). 
           </p></div>
           <h2> Punctuating compound sentences</h2>
        <div class="kk"><p>Comma  and coordinating conjunction 
            colon or semi-colon  can be used if there is strong relationship between the clauses. 
            e.g.A teacher affects eternity; no one can tell where his/her influence can stops. 
            Colon is used when we want to explain the first idea with the second one. 
            e.g. The diver knew what to do. He told to the captain
             The diver knew what to do: He told to the captain
             Join the simple sentences into compound one.  
             He had eaten. He was still hungry.
             She came.  We had invited her.
             The baby cried. His mother went out.
             Beti studied hard. She didn’t pass the exam.
             Chala walks fast. He doesn’t reach on time</p></div>
             <h2>3.Complex Sentence</h2>
             <div class="kk"><p>Activity: How  are the following sentences  differs from simple or compound sentences? 
                <br>1. The construction industry is growing fast although there is shortage of construction materials.
                <br>2. I was playing chase when my friend arrived with his leg bleeding.
                <br>3. The walls which were plastered with dirt had an unpleasant smell.
                Please, note the clauses they contain as you read.

</p></div>
        <h2>4. Compound-complex sentences</h2>
             <div class="kk"><p>It Contain at least two independent and one dependent clause. Consider this example. 
                They wanted to go on writing and telephoning, but after they moved into my house I told them to stop.

                </p></div>
                <h2>Summary on types of sentences </h2>
             <div class="kk"><p>It is the number and  types of clause (dependent and independent ) that help us in deciding the structure of a sentence. Consider this summary 
                Identify the dependent and independent clause(s), and then decide the type of sentence they are.
