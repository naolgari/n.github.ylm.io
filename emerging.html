    <h1>CHAPTER ONE</h1>
    <h2>Introduction to
        Emerging Technology</h2>


    <div class="kk"><p> Is a term generally used to describe a new technology
• It may also refer to the continuing development of existing
technology
• The term commonly refers to technologies that are currently
developing, or that are expected to be available within the
next five to ten years
• The term is usually reserved for technologies that are
creating or are expected to create significant social or ecconomic effect</p></div>
<h2>What is the root word of Technology and Evolution?</h2>
    <div class="kk"><p>echnology
        • 1610s, "discourse or treatise on an art or the arts," from Greek
        tekhnologia "systematic treatment of an art, craft, or technique,"
        • Originally referring to grammar, from tekhno- (see techno-) + -logy.
        • The meaning "science of the mechanical and industrial arts" is first
        recorded in 1859.
        Evolution
        • Evolution means the process of developing by gradual changes.
        • This noun is from Latin evolutio, "an unrolling or opening," combined
        from the prefix e-, "out," plus volvere, "to roll.</p></div>
        <h2>List of some currently available Emerged Technologies</h2>
    <div class="kk"><p> Artificial Intelligence
        • Blockchain <br>
        • Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality<br>

        • Big Data<br>
        • Robotic Processor Automation (RPA)</p></div>
        <h2>Introduction to the Industrial Revolution (IR)</h2>
    <div class="kk"><p> A period of major industrialization and innovation that took place
        during the late 1700s and early 1800s.
        • IR occurs when a society shifts from using tools to make products to
        use new sources of energy, such as coal, to power machines in
        factories.
        • The revolution started in England, with a series of innovations to make
        labor more efficient and productive.
        • IR was a time when the manufacturing of goods moved from small
        shops and homes to large factories.
        • This shift brought about changes in culture as people moved from
        rural areas to big cities in order to work. <br>The American Industrial Revolution commonly referred to as the
        Second Industrial Revolution, started sometime between 1820
        and 1870.
        • Industries such as textile manufacturing, mining, glass making,
        and agriculture all had undergone changes.
        • For example, prior to the Industrial Revolution, textiles were
        primarily made of wool and were handspun.
        • From the first industrial revolution (mechanization through
        water and steam power) to the mass production and assembly
        lines using electricity in the second, the fourth industrial
        revolution will take what was started in the third with the
        adoption of computers and automation and enhance it with smart
        and autonomous systems fueled by data and machine learning.</p></div>
    <div class="kk"><p> Generally, the following industrial revolutions
        fundamentally changed and transfer the world around
        us into modern society. <br>
        • The steam engine, <br>
        • The age of science and mass production, and <br>
        • The rise of digital technology <br>
        • Smart and autonomous systems fueled by data and
        machine learning <br>
        • The Most Important Inventions of the Industrial
        Revolution <br>
        • Transportation: The Steam Engine, The Railroad, The Diesel
        Engine, The Airplane.<br>
        • Communication.: The Telegraph, Transatlantic Cable,
        Phonograph, the Telephone.<br>
        • Industry: The Cotton Gin. The Sewing Machine. Electric
        </p></div>
        <h2>Historical Background (IR 1.0, IR 2.0, IR 3.0)</h2>
    <div class="kk"><p> The industrial revolution began in Great Britain in the late 1770s
        before spreading to the rest of Europe.
        • The first European countries to be industrialized after England
        were Belgium, France, and the German states.
        • The final cause of the Industrial Revolution was the effects
        created by the Agricultural Revolution.
        • As previously stated, the Industrial Revolution began in Britain in
        the 18th century due in part to an increase in food production,
        which was the key outcome of the Agricultural Revolution. <br>The four types of industries are:
        • Primary industry involves getting raw materials e.g. mining,
        farming, and fishing. <br>
        • Secondary industry involves manufacturing e.g. making cars
        and steel. <br>
        • Tertiary industries provide a service e.g. teaching and nursing. <br>
        • Quaternary industry involves research and development
        industries e.g. IT
    </p></div>
    <h2> Industrial Revolution (IR 1.0)</h2>
    <div class="kk"><p> The Industrial Revolution (IR) is described as a transition to new
        manufacturing processes.
        • IR was first coined in the 1760s, during the time where this revolution
        began.
        • The transitions in the first IR included going from hand production
        methods to machines, the increasing use of steam power, the development
        of machine tools and the rise of the factory system.

    <h2>Industrial Revolution (IR 2.0)</h2>

    <div class="kk"><p>Also known as the Technological Revolution, began somewhere in the
1870s.
• The advancements in IR 2.0 included the development of methods for
manufacturing interchangeable parts and widespread adoption of pre-
existing technological systems such as telegraph and railroad networks.
• This adoption allowed the vast movement of people and ideas, enhancing
communication.
• Moreover, new technological systems were introduced, such as electrical
power and telephones</p></div>
<h2>Industrial Revolution (IR 3.0)</h2>
    <div class="kk"><p>Introduced the transition from mechanical and analog electronic
        technology to digital electronics which began from the late 1950s.
        • Due to the shift towards digitalization, IR 3.0 was given the nickname,
        “Digital Revolution”.
        • The core factor of this revolution is the mass production and widespread
        use of digital logic circuits and its derived technologies such as the
        computer, handphones and the Internet.
        • These technological innovations have arguably transformed traditional
        production and business techniques enabling people to communicate with
        another without the need of being physically present.
        • Certain practices that were enabled during IR 3.0 is still being practiced
        until this current day, for example – the proliferation of digital computers
        and digital recor

   <h2> • Industrial Revolution (IR 4.0)</h2>

    <div class="kk"><p> Now, with advancements in various technologies such as robotics, Internet
of Things (IoT), additive manufacturing and autonomous vehicles, the term
“Fourth Industrial
• Revolution” or IR 4.0 was coined by Klaus Schwab, the founder and
executive chairman of World Economic Forum, in the year 2016.
• The technologies mentioned above are what you call – cyber physical
systems.
• A cyber-physical system is a mechanism that is controlled or monitored by
computer-based algorithms, tightly integrated with the Internet and its
users.
• Examples: Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machines and Artificial
Intelligence (AI).
• CNC Machines: operated by giving it instructions using a computer
• AI: one of the main elements that give life to Autonomous Vehicles and
Automated Robots.</p></div>
      <h2>Role of Data for Emerging Technology</h2>
    <div class="kk"><p>Data is regarded as the new oil and strategic asset since we are living in the
        age of big data, and drives or even determines the future of science,
        technology, the economy, and possibly everything in our world today and
        tomorrow.
        • Data have not only triggered tremendous hype and buzz but more
        importantly, presents enormous challenges that in turn bring incredible
        innovation and economic opportunities.
        • This reshaping and paradigm-shifting are driven not just by data itself but all
        other aspects that could be created, transformed, and/or adjusted by
        understanding, exploring, and utilizing data.The preceding trend and its potential have triggered new debate about data-
        intensive scientific discovery as an emerging technology, the so-called “fourth
        industrial revolution,” There is no doubt, nevertheless, that the potential of
        data science and analytics to enable data-driven theory, economy, and
        professional development is increasingly being recognized.
        • This involves not only core disciplines such as computing, informatics, and
        statistics, but also the broad-based fields of business, social science, and
        health/medical science</p></div>
        <h2>Enabling Devices & Network (Programmable Devices)</h2>
    <div class="kk"><p>In the world of digital electronic systems, there are four basic kinds of
        devices: memory, microprocessors, logic, and networks.
        • Memory devices store random information such as the contents of a
        spreadsheet or database.
        • Microprocessors execute software instructions to perform a wide variety of
        tasks such as running a word processing program or video game.
        • Logic devices provide specific functions, including device-to-device
        interfacing, data communication, signal processing, data display, timing and
        control operations, and almost every other function a system must perform.
        • Network is a collection of computers, servers, mainframes, network devices,
        peripherals, or other devices connected to one another to allow the sharing of
        data.
        • Example of a network is the Internet, which connects millions of people all
        over the world Programmable devices usually refer to chips that incorporate
        field programmable logic devices (FPLDs), complex programmable logic
        devices (CPLD) and programmable logic devices (PLD).
        • There are also devices that are the analog equivalent of these called field
        programmable analog arrays.</p></div>
    <div class="kk"><p> Why is a computer referred to as a programmable device? <br>
        • Because a computer follows a set of instructions.<br>
        • Many electronic devices are computers that perform only one operation,
        but they are still following instructions that reside permanently in the unit.
        • List of some Programmable devices<br>

        • Hosting equipment and servers</p></div>
        <h2>Human to Machine Interaction(HMI)</h2>
       
    <div class="kk"><p> HMI refers to the communication and interaction between a human and a machine via
        a user interface.
        • Nowadays, natural user interfaces such as gestures have gained increasing attention as
        they allow humans to control machines through natural and intuitive behaviors.
        1. What is interaction in human-computer interaction?
        • HCI (human-computer interaction) is the study of how people interact with
        computers and to what extent computers are or are not developed for
        successful interaction with human beings.
        • As its name implies, HCI consists of three parts: the User, the Computer
        itself, and the ways they work together.
        2. How do users interact with computers?
        • The user interacts directly with hardware for the human input and output
        such as displays, e.g. through a graphical user interface.
        • The user interacts with the computer over this software interface using the
        given input and output (I/O) hardware.
        21
      
        3. How important is human-computer interaction?
        • The goal of HCI is to improve the interaction between users and computers
        by making computers more user-friendly and receptive to the user's needs.
        • The main advantages of HCI are
        • Simplicity
        • Ease of deployment & operations
        • Cost savings for smaller set-ups
        • Reduce solution design time and integration complexity</p></div>
