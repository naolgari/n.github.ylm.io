    <h1>LOGIC</h1>
    <h2>CHAPTER ONE <br> BASIC CONCEPTS OF LOGIC </h2>
    <div class="kk"><p>Lesson 1: Basic Concepts of Logic: <br>
        Arguments,  <br>
        Premises and  <br>
        Conclusions  <br>
        The word logic comes from Greek word logos, which means sentence, discourse, reason, truth and rule. 
        Logic in its broader meaning is the science, 
        Which evaluates arguments and 
        The study of methods and principles of correct reasoning or the art of correct reasoning</p></div>
        <div class="kk"><p>Logic can be defined in different ways. Here below are some definitions of logic: 
            Logic is a science that evaluates arguments.  
            Logic is a science that helps to develop the method and principles that we may use as a criterion for evaluating the arguments of others and as a guide to construct good arguments of our own. 
            Logic is the attempt to codify the rules of rational thought. 
            Logicians explore the structure of arguments that preserve truth or allow the optimal extraction of knowledge from evidence. 
            </p></div>
        <div class="kk"><p>In logic, as an academic discipline, we study
            Reasoning itself 
            Forms of argument, 
            General principles and particular errors, along with methods of arguing. 
            We see lots of mistakes in reasoning in daily life and logic can help us understand what is wrong or why someone is arguing in a particular way. 
            What is the Benefit of Studying Logic?
            Logic sharpens and refines our natural gifts to think, reason and argue.  
            We use logic in our day-to-day communications
            </p></div>
        <div class="kk"><p>It helps us to develop the skill needed to construct sound (good) and fallacy-free    arguments of one‘s own and to evaluate the arguments of others; 
            It provides a fundamental defense against the prejudiced and uncivilized attitudes that threaten the foundation of a civilized and democratic society; 
            It helps us to distinguish good arguments from bad arguments; 
            It helps us to understand and identify the common logical errors in reasoning;  
            It helps us to understand and identify the common confusions that often happen due to misuse of language; 
            It enables us to disclose ill-conceived policies in the political sphere, to be careful of disguises, and to distinguish the rational from irrational and the sane from the insane and so on. 
            In fact, one of the goals of logic is to produce individuals who are critical, rational and reasonable both in the sphere of public and private life. 
            However, to be full beneficial of the worth which logic provides, one must thoroughly and carefully understand the basic concepts of the subject and be able to apply them in the actual situations. 
            </p></div>
            <h2>What is an Argument? </h2>
        <div class="kk"><p>‘Argument‘ may not be a new word to all of us. For all of us encounter arguments in our day-to-day experience. 
            We read them in books and newspapers, hear them on television, and formulate them when communicating with friends and associates. 
            Argument is a technical term and the chief concern of logic. Argument might have defined and described in different ways. 
            When we define an arguments from logical point of view, it is a group of statements, one or more of which (the premise) are claimed to provide support for, or reason to believe, one of the other, the (conclusion). 
            As is apparent from the above definition, the term ‘argument’ has a very specific meaning in logic. 
            It does not mean, for example, a mere verbal fight, as one might have with one‘s parent, spouse, or friend 
            </p></div>
        <div class="kk"><p>Let us examine the features of this definition in detail. 
            First, an argument is a group of statements. That is, the first requirement for a passage to be qualified as an argument is to combine two or more statements. But, what is a statement? 
            A statement is a declarative sentence that has a truth-value of either true or false. 
            That is, statement is a sentence that has truth-value. 
            Hence, truth and falsity are the two possible truth values of a statement. A statement is typically a declarative sentence. 
            In other words, statement is a type of sentence that could stand as a declarative sentence. 
            Look the following examples: <br>
            Dr. Abiy Ahmed the current Prime Minister of Ethiopia. <br>
            Mekelle is the capital city of Tigray Region.  <br>
            Ethiopia was colonized by Germany. <br>
            </p></div>
        <div class="kk"><p>Statement (a) and (b) are true, because they describe things as they are, or assert what really is the case. Hence, “Truth‟ is their truth-value. 
            Whereas statement (c) is false because it asserts what is not, and “Falsity‟ its truth-value. 
            N.B: Logicians used proposition and statement interchangeably. 
            However, in strict (technical) sense, proposition is the meaning or information content of a statement. 
            In this chapter, the term statement is used to refer premises and a conclusion. 
            However, there are sentences that are not statements, and hence should be used to construct an argument. 
            Examples: <br>
             A. Would you close the window? (Question)  <br>
             B. Let us study together. (Proposal)   <br>
            C. Right on! (Exclamation)    <br>
            D. I suggest that you read philosophy texts. (Suggestion)   <br>
            E. Give me your ID Card, Now! (Command)   <br>
            </p></div>
        <div class="kk"><p>In fact, sentence is a group of words or phrases that enables us to express ideas or thought meaningfully. 
            However, unlike statements, none of the above sentences can be either true or false. 
            Hence, none of them can be classified as statement and can’t make up an argument
            Second, the statements that make up an argument are divided into premise(s) and conclusion. 
            However, a passage contains two or more statements cannot guarantee  the existence of an argument. 
            Hence, an argument is a group statement, which contains at least one premise and one and only one conclusion. 
            This definition makes it clear that an argument may contain more than one premise but only one conclusion. 
            </p></div>
        <div class="kk"><p>Argument always attempts to justify a claim. 
            The claim that the statement attempts to justify is known as a conclusion of an argument; and 
            The statement (s) that supposedly justify the claim is/are known as the premises of the argument. 
            Therefore, a premise is a statement that set forth the reason or evidence. It is claimed evidence; 
            Conclusion is a statement, which is claimed to follow from the given evidence (premise). 
            In other words, the conclusion is the claim that an argument is trying to establish.
            </p></div>
        <div class="kk"><p>Let us now construct arguments together. 
            Example-1:                                                                                       
            All Ethiopians are Africans. (Premise 1) 
            Tsionawit is Ethiopian. (Premise2) 
            Therefore, Tsionawit is African. (Conclusion) 
            Example-2:  
            Some Africans are black. (Premise-1) 
            Zelalem is an African. (Premise-2) 
            Therefore, Zelalem is black. (Conclusion)
            The claim that the premises support the conclusion, (and/or that the conclusion follow from the premises), is indicated by the word “therefore.‘‘ </p></div>
        <div class="kk"><p>All arguments may be placed in one of two basic groups: 
            Those in which the premises really do support the conclusion -are said to be good (well-supported) arguments
            Those in which they do not, even though they are claimed to- are said to be bad (poorly-supported) arguments. 
            For example, in the first argument, the premises really do support the conclusion, they give good reason for believing that the conclusion is true, and therefore, the argument is a good one. 
            But the premises of the second argument fail to support the conclusion adequately. 
            Even if they may be true, they do not provide good reason to believe that the conclusion is true. 
            Therefore, it is bad argument, but it is still an argument. 
            </p></div>
            <h2>How can we distinguish premises from conclusion and vice versa? 
            </h2>
        <div class="kk"><p>One of the most important tasks  of Logic in the analysis of arguments is to distinguish premises from conclusion and vice versa.   
            Since it is impossible to analyze arguments without identifying a conclusion from premises, we need techniques that can help us to identify premises from a conclusion and vice versa. 
            The first technique is to looking at an indicator word. 
            Frequently, arguments contain certain indicator words that provide clues in identifying premises and conclusion. </p></div>
        <div class="kk"><p>Here below are some Conclusion Indicators: 
            Therefore 	Wherefore 		Accordingly 
            Provided that 	It must be that 	We may conclude 
            Entails that 	Hence 		It shows that 
            Whence 		Thus 			Consequently 
            We may infer 	It implies that 	As a result 
            So 			It follows that
            In an argument that contains any of these indicator words, the statement that follows these words can usually be identified as the conclusion. 
            By the process of elimination, the other statements in the argument can be identified as premises, but only based on their logical importance to the identified conclusion. 
       Example: 
      Women are mammals. 
      Zenebech is a woman. 
      Therefore, Zenebech is a mammal.  </p></div>
        <div class="kk"><p>If an argument does not contain a conclusion indicator, it may contain a premise indicator. Some  typical Premise Indicators: 
            Since     from   As        indicated by 	   Because          Owing to
             Seeing that 	           Given that           As       For 	            In that 
            May be inferred          In as much as          For the reason that
       In an argument, a statement that follows these indicator words can usually be identified as a premise. 
       By same the process of elimination, the other remaining single statement will be a conclusion. 
       Example: You should avoid any form of cheating on exams, because, cheating on exams is punishable by the Senate Legislation of the University. 
       The word “for this reason‘‘  is special in that it comes immediately after the premise it indicates and before the conclusion. 
       This indicator can be both premise and conclusion indicator.
       </p></div>
        <div class="kk"><p>Sometimes a single indicator can be used to identify more than one premise. Consider the following argument: 
            Tsionawit is a faithful wife, for Ethiopian women are faithful wives and Tsionawit is an Ethiopian. 
            The premise indicator “for‘‘ goes with both “Ethiopian women are faithful wives‘‘ and “Tsionawit is an Ethiopian”. These are the premises. By process of elimination, “Tsionawit is a faithful wife” is the conclusion. 
            Sometimes you may have an argument that contains no indicator at all: neither a conclusion nor a premise indicator word. 
            When this occurs, the reader/ listener must ask himself or herself such questions as:   
            What single statement is claimed (implicitly) to follow from the others? 
            What is the arguer trying to prove? 
            What is the main point in the passage?  
            The answers to these questions should point to the conclusion. </p></div>
        <div class="kk"><p>Example: 
            Our country should increase the quality and quantity of its military. Ethnic conflicts are recently intensified; boarder conflicts are escalating; international terrorist activities are increasing. 
            The main point of this argument is to show that the country should increase the size and quality of its military. 
            All the rest are given in support of the conclusion.  
            The standard form of this argument is: 
            Ethnic conflicts are recently intensified. (P-1)                                         
            Boarder conflicts are escalating. (P-2)       
            International terrorist activities are increasing. (P-3)  
            Thus, the country should increase the quality and quantity of its military. (C) 
            </p></div>
        <div class="kk"><p>Passages that contain arguments sometimes contain statements that are neither premises nor conclusion. 
            Only statements that are actually intended to support the conclusion should be included in the list of premises.  
            Example: Socialized medicine is not recommended because it would result in a reduction in the overall quality of medical care available to the average citizen. In addition, it might very well bankrupt the federal treasury. This is the whole case against socialized medicine in a nutshell. 
            The conclusion of this argument is “Socialized medicine is not recommended,‘‘ and the two statements following the word “because‘‘ are the premises. 
            The last statement makes only a passing comment about the argument itself and is therefore neither a premise nor a conclusion. 
            Inference in the narrower sense it means the reasoning process expressed by the argument. And broadly it refers the argument itself. 
            For the purpose of this course, we use the narrower sense of the term inference or inferential link between the premises and the conclusion of arguments. 
            </p></div>
           
            <H2>Techniques of Recognizing Arguments</H2>
        <div class="kk"><p>An argument is a systematic combination of one or more than one statements; 
            Which are claimed to provide a logical support or evidence (i.e., premise(s) to another single statement 
            Which is claimed to follow logically from the alleged evidence (i.e., conclusion). 
            However, not all passages that contain two or more statements are argumentative. 
            Argumentative passages are distinguished from such kind of non-argumentative passages by their primary goal: proving something. 
            In a general, a passage contains an argument if it purports to prove something; if it does not do so, it does not contain an argument.</p></div>
        <div class="kk"><p>Two conditions must be fulfilled for a passage to purport to prove something:  
            1. At least one of the statements must claim to present evidence  
       2. There must be a claim that the alleged evidence or reasons supports or implies  something- that is, a claim that something follows from the alleged evidence. 
       The first condition refers to premises as it tries to provide or claim to provide reasons or evidences for the conclusion; and 
       The second condition refers to a conclusion. 
       It is not necessary that the premises present actual evidence or true reasons nor that the premises actually do support the conclusion. 
       But at least the premises must claim to present evidence or reasons, and there must be a claim that the evidence or reasons support or imply something. 
       </p></div>
        <div class="kk"><p>The first condition expresses a factual claim, and deciding whether it is fulﬁlled often falls outside the domain of logic. 
            The second condition expresses what is called an inferential claim. 
            The inferential claim is simply the claim that the passage expresses a certain kind of reasoning process- that something supports or implies something or that something follows from something. 
            Also, you should recognize that this claim is not equitable with the intentions of the arguer. 
            Intentions are subjective and, as such, are usually not accessible to the evaluator. 
            Rather, the inferential claim is an objective feature of an argument grounded in its language or structure. 
            In evaluating arguments, therefore, most of our attention will be concentrated on whether the second condition is fulfilled because it is not necessary, at least at this level, that the premises present actual evidence or true reasons nor that do the premises actually support the conclusion. 
            </p></div>
        <div class="kk"><p>An inferential claim can be either explicit or implicit. 
            An explicit inferential claim is usually asserted by premise or conclusion indicator words (“thus,‘‘ “since,‘‘ “because,‘‘ “hence,‘‘ “therefore,‘‘  etc). 
            It exists if there is an indicator word that asserts an explicit relationship between the premises and the conclusions. 
            Example: Gamachuu is my biological father, because my mother told so. 
            An implicit inferential claim exists if there is an inferential relationship between the statements in a passage, but the passage contains no indicator words. 
             Example: The genetic modification of food is risky business. Genetic engineering can introduce unintended changes into the DNA of the food-producing organism, and these changes can be toxic to the consumer. 
            The ﬁrst statement is the conclusion, and the other two are the premises. 
            </p></div>
        <div class="kk"><p>Sometimes it is difficult to identify whether a passage contain an argument.  In deciding whether there is a claim that evidence supports or implies something keep an eye out for 
            Indicator words, and 
            The presence of an inferential claim between the statements. In connection with these points, a word of caution(carefulness) is in order. 
            First, the mere occurrence of an indicator word by no means guarantees the presence of an argument. 
            The presence of an indicator word does not mean that the existing indicator word actually and always indicate a premises or a conclusions. 
            Thus, before deciding that an indicator word indicates a premises or a conclusion, make sure that the existing indicator word is used to indicate a premise or a conclusion. 
            Example: 
            Since Edison invented the phonograph, there have been many technological developments. 
            Since Edison invented the phonograph, he deserves credit for a major technological development. 
            In the first passage the word  “since‘‘ is used in a temporal sense. It means “from the time that.‘‘ Thus, the first passage is not an argument. 
            In the second passage “since‘‘ is used in a logical sense, and so the passage is an argument. 
            </p></div>
        <div class="kk"><p>Second, it is not always easy to detect the occurrences of an inferential relationship between statements in a passage, and the reader may have to review a passage several times before making a decision. 
            Therefore, in deciding whether a passage contains an argument one should try to insert mentally some indicators words among the statements to see whether there is a flow of ideas among the statements. 
            Even with this mental experiment, however, deciding whether a passage contains an argument is very difficult.  
            To assists in distinguishing passages that contain arguments from those that do not, it is important to identify passages, which do not contain arguments: Non-argumentative passages. 
            </p></div>
            <h2>2.2. Recognizing Non-argumentative Passages </h2>
        <div class="kk"><p>Non-argumentative passages are passages, which lack an inferential claim. These include:
            Simple non-inferential passages,	 Illustrations, 	Explanations
            Expository passages  		 	conditional statements. 
            Passages that lack an inferential claim may be statements, which could be premises, conclusion, or both. 
            What is missed is a claim that a reasoning process is being made.
            Simple Non-inferential Passages : are unproblematic passages that lack a claim that anything is being proved. 
            Such passages contain statements that could be premises or conclusions (or both), but what is missing is a claim that any potential premise supports a conclusion or that any potential conclusion is supported by premises. 
            Passages of this sort include: 
            Warnings, 	Pieces of advice, 		Reports. 
            Statements  of belief or opinion, 
            Loosely associated statements, 
            </p></div>
            
            <h2> Types of Arguments</h2>
            <H2>Deduction and Induction 
            </H2>
            <H2>3.1 Deductive Arguments    </H2>
        <div class="kk"><p>A deductive argument is an argument  in which the premises are claimed to support the conclusion in such a way that it is impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion false. 
            In such arguments, the conclusion is claimed to follow necessarily (conclusively) from the premises. 
            Thus, deductive arguments are those that involve necessary reasoning. 
            Example-1: 
            All philosophers are critical thinkers. 
            Socrates is a philosopher. 
            Therefore, Socrates is a critical thinker. 
            Example-2: 
            All African footballers are blacks. 
            Messi is an African footballer. 
            It follows that, Messi is black.

            <h2>3.2 Inductive Arguments    
            </h2>
        <div class="kk"><p>An inductive argument is an argument in which the premises are claimed to support the conclusion in such a way that it is improbable for the premises to be true and the conclusion false. 
            In such arguments, the conclusion is claimed to follow only probably from the premises. 
            The premises may provide some considerable evidence for the conclusion but they do not imply (necessarily support) the conclusion. 
            In this case, we might have sufficient condition (evidence) but we cannot be certain about the truth of the conclusion. 
            However, this does not mean that the conclusion is wrong or unacceptable, where as it could be correct or acceptable but only based on probability. 
            Thus, inductive arguments are those that involve probabilistic reasoning.    
            Example-1: 
            Most African leaders are blacks. 
            Mandela was an African leader. 
            Therefore, probably Mandela was black. 
            Example-2: 
            Almost all women are mammals. 
            Hanan is a woman. 
            Hence, Hanan is a mammal.

            <h2>3.3 Differentiating Deductive and Inductive Arguments 
            </h2>
        <div class="kk"><p>The distinction between inductive and deductive arguments lies in the strength of an argument‘s inferential claim; that is, on how strongly the conclusion is claimed to follow from the premises, or how strongly the premises are claimed to support the conclusion. 
            However, in most arguments, the strength of this claim is not explicitly stated, so we must use our interpretative abilities to evaluate it. 
            In the deciding whether an argument is deductive or inductive, we must look at certain objective features of the argument. 
            There are three factors that influence the decision about the deductiveness or inductiveness of an argument‘s inferential claim. These are: 
            1) The occurrence of special indicator words, 
            2) The actual strength of the inferential link between premises and conclusion, and 
            3) The character or form of argumentation the arguers use.
            </p></div>
            <h2>1. The occurrence of special indicator words. 
            </h2>
        <div class="kk"><p>There are different sort of indicator words that indicate or mark the type of a certain argument. 
            Arguments may contain some words that indicate the arguer‘s certainty and confidence, or the arguer‘s uncertainty or doubt, about the truth of his/her conclusion. 
            Words like : ‘certainly’, ‘necessarily’, ‘absolutely’, and ‘definitely‘ indicate that the argument should be taken as deductive, 
            Whereas words like, ‘probable/improbable’, plausible/implausible’ ‘likely/unlikely,‘ and ‘reasonable to conclude’ suggest that an argument is inductive. 
             (Note that the phrase “it must be the case that‘‘ is ambiguous; “must‘‘ can indicate either probability or necessity)
            </p></div>
            <h2>2. The actual strength of the inferential link between premises and conclusion. 
            </h2>
        <div class="kk"><p>If the conclusion actually does follow with strict necessity from the premises, the argument is clearly deductive. In such an argument, it is impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion false. 
            If the conclusion of an argument does not follow with strict necessity but does follow probably, it is inductive argument. Consider the following examples. 
            Example-1: 
            All Ethiopian people love their country. 
            Debebe is an Ethiopian. 
            Therefore, Debebe loves his country. 	Deductive
            Example-2: 
            The majority of Ethiopian people are poor. 
            Alamudin is an Ethiopian. 
            Therefore, Alamudin is poor. 	Inductive </p></div>
            <h2>3. The character or form of argumentation the arguer uses.</h2>
        <div class="kk"><p>A. Instances of Deductive Argumentative Forms 
            Many arguments have a distinctive character or form that indicates that the premises are supposed to provide absolute support for the conclusion. 
            Five examples of such forms or kinds of argumentation are: 	
            Arguments based on mathematics, 
            Arguments from deﬁnition, and 
            Syllogisms: Categorical, Hypothetical, and Disjunctive syllogisms. 
            Argument based on mathematics: it is an argument in which the conclusions depend on some purely arithmetic or geometric computation or measurement. 
            For example, you can put two orange and three bananas in a bag and conclude that the bag contains five fruits. 
            Since all arguments in pure mathematics are deductive, we can usually consider arguments that depend on mathematics to be deductive as well. 
            A noteworthy exception, however, is arguments that depend on statistics are usually best interpreted as inductive. </p></div>
        <div class="kk"><p>Arguments based on definition: it is an argument in which the conclusion is claimed to depend merely up on the definition of some words or phrase used in the premise or conclusion. 
            For example, 
            One may argue that Angel is honest; it is follows that Angel tells the truth. 
            Kebede is a physician; therefore, he is a doctor. 
            These arguments are deductive because their conclusions follow with necessity from the definitions, “honest” and “physician”. 
            Syllogisms are arguments consisting of exactly two premises and one conclusion. 
            Syllogisms can be categorized into three groups; categorical, hypothetical, and disjunctive syllogism.  
            Categorical syllogism: a syllogism is an argument consisting of exactly two premises and one conclusion and  a syllogism in which the statement begins with one of the words ‘All’, ‘No’ and ‘Some’. 
            Example: 
            All Egyptians are Muslims. 
            No Muslim is a Christian.  
            Hence, no Egyptian is a Christian. </p></div>
        <div class="kk"><p>Hypothetical syllogism: It is a syllogism having a conditional statement for one or both of its premises. 
            Example: 
            If you study hard, then you will graduate with Distinction. 
            If you graduate with Distinction, then you will get a rewarding job. 
            Therefore, if you study hard, then you will get a rewarding job. 
            Disjunctive syllogism: it is a syllogism having a disjunctive statement. (I.e. an ‘either … or’ statement.) 
            Example: 
            Rewina is either Ethiopian or Eritrean. 
            Rewina is not Eritrean. 
            Therefore, Rewina is Ethiopian. 
            </p></div>
            <h2>Instances of Inductive Argumentative Forms </h2>
        <div class="kk"><p>In general, inductive arguments are such that the content of the conclusion is in some way intended to ―go beyond‖ the content of the premises. 
            The premises of such an argument typically deal with some subject that is relatively familiar, and the conclusion then moves beyond this to a subject that is less familiar or that little is known about. 
            Such an argument may take any of several forms: 
            Predictions about the future, 
            Arguments from analogy, 
            Inductive generalizations, 
            Arguments from authority, 
            Arguments based on signs, and 
            Causal inferences, to name just a few. 
            Prediction: in a prediction the premises deals with some known event in the present or the past and the conclusions moves beyond this event to some event to relative future. 
            </p></div>
        <div class="kk"><p>An argument from analogy: It is an argument that depends on the existence of an analogy or similarity between two things or state of affairs. 
            Because of the existence of this analogy a certain conditions that affects the better- known thing or situations is concluded to affect the less familiar , lesser known-thing or situation. 
            For instance, one may conclude, after observing the similarity of some features of Computer A and computer B: that both are manufactured in 2012; that both are easy to access; that Computer A is fast in processing; it follows that Computer B is also fast in processing. 
            This argument depends on the existence of a similarity or analogy between the two cars. 
            The certitude attending such an inference is obviously probabilistic at best. 
            </p></div>
        <div class="kk"><p>Arguments based on sign: it is an argument that proceeds from the knowledge of a certain sign to the knowledge of a thing or situation that the sign symbolizes. 
            For instance, one may infer that after observing ‘No Parking‘ sign posted on the side of a road, the area is not allowed for parking. But because the sign might be displaced or in error about the area or forgotten, conclusion follows only probably.  
            A causal inference: it is an argument which proceed from the knowledge of a cause to the knowledge of an effect, or from the knowledge of an effect to knowledge of a cause. 
            For example, from the knowledge that a bottle of water had been accidentally left in the freezer overnight, someone might conclude that it had frozen (cause to eﬀect). 
            Conversely, after tasting a piece of chicken and ﬁnding it dry and tough, one might conclude that it had been overcooked (eﬀect to cause). 
            Because specific instances of cause and effect can never be known with absolute certainty, one may usually interpret such an argument as inductive. 
            </p></div>
        <div class="kk"><p>One broad classification of arguments not listed in this survey is scientific arguments. 
            Arguments that occur in science can be either inductive or deductive, depending on the circumstances. 
            In general, arguments aimed at the discovery of a law of nature are usually considered inductive. 
            Another type of argument that occurs in science has to do with the application of known laws to specific circumstances. Arguments of this sort are often considered to be deductive, but only with certain reservations. 
            A final point needs to be made about the distinction between inductive and deductive arguments. 
            For instance, Aristotle that holds that inductive arguments are those that proceed from the particular to the general, while deductive arguments are those that proceed from the general to the particular. 
            (A particular statement is one that makes a claim about one or more particular members of a class, while a general statement makes a claim about all the members of a class.) 
            In fact, there are deductive arguments that proceed from the general to the general, from the particular to the particular, and from the particular to the general, as well as from the general to the particular; and there are inductive arguments that do the same. </p></div>
        <div class="kk"><p>For example, here is a deductive argument that proceeds from the particular to the general: 
            Three is a prime number.                        
            Five is a prime number.                        
            Seven is a prime number.                      
            Therefore, all odd numbers between two and eight are prime numbers. 
            Here is an inductive argument that proceeds from the general to the particular: 
            All emeralds previously found have been green.                    Therefore, the next emerald to be found will be green. 
            In sum up, to distinguish deductive arguments from inductive, we look for: 
            Special indicator words, 
            The actual strength of the inferential link between premises and conclusion, and 
            The character or form of argumentation. 
            </p></div>
           
            <H1>Evaluating Arguments</H1>
        <div class="kk"><p>In our previous lesson, we have seen that every argument makes two basic claims: 
            A claim that evidence or reasons exist (factual claim) and 
            A claim that the alleged evidence or reasons support something (or that something follows from the alleged evidence or reasons)- inferential claim. 
            The evaluation of every argument centers on the evaluation of these two claims. 
            The most important of the two is the inferential claim, because if the premises fail to support the conclusion (that is, if the reasoning is bad), an argument is worthless. 
            Thus, we will always test the inferential claim first, and only if the premises do support the conclusion will we test the factual claim (that is, the claim that the premises present genuine evidence, or are true). 
            </p></div>
            <h2>Evaluating Deductive Arguments: <br>
                Validity, Truth, and Soundness   
            </h2>
            <h2>A. Deduction and Validity 
            </h2>
        <div class="kk"><p>The previous section defined a deductive argument as one in which the premises are claimed to support the conclusion in such a way that if they are assumed true, it is impossible for the conclusions to be false. 
            If the premises do in fact support the conclusions in this way the arguments is said to be valid; if not, it is invalid. 
            Thus, a valid deductive argument is an argument such that if the premises are assumed true, it is impossible for the conclusion to be false. 
            In such arguments, the conclusion follows with strict necessity from the premises. 
            Conversely, an invalid deductive argument is an argument such that if the premises are assumed true, it is possible for the conclusion to be false. 
            In these arguments, the conclusion does not follow with strict necessity from the premises, even though it is claimed to. 
            </p></div>
        <div class="kk"><p>Consider the following examples: 
            Example-1: 
        All men are mammals. 
        All bulls are men. 
        Therefore, all bulls are mammals. 
           Example-2: 
        All philosophers are rational. 
        Socrates was rational. 
        Therefore, Socrates was a philosopher. 
    The first example is valid argument, because the conclusion actually followed from the premises with a strict necessity. 
    If all men are assumed as mammals and bulls as men, then it is impossible for bulls not be mammals. Hence, the argument is valid. 
    The second example is invalid argument, because the conclusion did not actually follow from the premises with a strict necessity, even though it is claimed to. 
    That is, even if we assume that all philosophers rational and Socrates is rational, it is not actually impossible for Socrates not be a philosopher. 
    </p></div>
        <div class="kk"><p>The above definitions of valid and invalid arguments, along with their corresponding examples, lead us into two immediate conclusions. 
            The first is that there is no middle ground between valid and invalid. An argument is either valid or invalid. 
            The second consequence is that there is only an indirect relation between validity and truth. 
            For an argument to be valid it is not necessary that either the premises or the conclusions be true, but merely that if the premises assumed true, it is impossible for the conclusion be false. 
            That is, we do not have to know whether the premise of an argument is actually true in order to determine its validity (valid or invalid). 
            To test an argument for validity, we begin by assuming that all premises are true, and then we determine if it is possible, in light of that assumption, for the conclusion to be false. 
            Thus, the validity of argument is the connection between premise and conclusion rather than on the actual truth or falsity of the statement formed the argument</p></div>
        <div class="kk"><p>There are four possibilities with respect to the truth or falsity of the premises and conclusion of a given argument: 
            1) True premises and True conclusion, 
            2) True premises and False conclusion, 
            3) False premises and True conclusion, and 
            4) False premises and False conclusion. 
            Note that all of the above possibilities, except the second case (true premises and false conclusion), allow for both valid and invalid arguments. That is, the second case does not allow for valid arguments. 
            As we have just seen, any argument having this combination is necessarily invalid. Let us discuss these possibilities in detail with examples. 
                Validity and Truth Value 
            Possibility # 1: A combination of True premises and True conclusion (the first case) allows for both valid and invalid arguments. Consider the following examples: 
                Example-1 (Valid): 
                All women are mammals. (Tp) 
                My mother is a mammal. (Tp) 
                Therefore, my mother is a woman. (Tc) 
                 Example-2 (Invalid): 
                All philosophers are critical thinkers. (Tp) 
                Plato was a critical thinker. (Tp) 
                Therefore, Plato was a philosopher. (Tc) </p></div>
                <h2>Deduction and Soundness 
                </h2>
        <div class="kk"><p>Depending on their actual ability, (assuming that they already have actually accomplished their inferential claims by being valid), to accomplish their factual claims, deductive arguments can be either sound or unsound. 
            A sound argument is a deductive argument that is valid and has all true premises. 
            Both conditions must be met for an argument to be sound, and if either is missing the argument is unsound. 
            A deductive argument that does not actually accomplish its inferential claim, (that is not valid), cannot be sound, regardless of the truth values of its premises. Such a deductive argument is unsound, by definition. 
            Thus, an unsound argument is a deductive argument that is either valid with one or more false premises, or invalid, or both. 
             A sound argument, therefore, is what is meant by a “good‘‘ deductive argument in the fullest sense of the term.
            Sound Argument = A valid argument + All true premises  
            </p></div>
            <h2>Evaluating Inductive Arguments: Strength, Truth, and Cogency </h2>

        <div class="kk"><p>Induction and Strength 
The previous section defined an inductive argument as one in which the premises are claimed to support the conclusions in such a way that if they are assumed true, it is improbable for the conclusions to be false. If the premises do in fact support the conclusions in this way the arguments is said to be strong; if not, it is weak. 
Thus, a strong inductive argument is an argument such that if the premises are assumed true, it is improbable for the conclusion to be false. In such arguments, the conclusion follows with Great probable Degree from the premises. 
Conversely, a weak inductive argument is an argument such that if the premises are assumed true, it is probable for the conclusions to be false. In these arguments, the conclusion does follow with Less probable Degree from the premises. Consider the following examples: 
Example-1: 
	This barrel contains one hundred apples. 
	Eighty apples selected at random were found tasty. 
	Therefore, probably all one hundred apples are tasty. 
 Example-2: 
	This barrel contains one hundred apples.  
	Three apples selected at random were found tasty. 
	Therefore, probably all one hundred apples are tasty.
</p></div>
        <div class="kk"><p>We have said earlier that there are four possibilities with respect to the truth or falsity of the premises and conclusion of a given argument: 
            True premises and True conclusion, 
            True premises and False conclusion, 
            False premises and True conclusion, and 
            False premises and False conclusion. These possibilities work in inductive arguments as well. 
            Note that all of the above possibilities, except the second case (true premises and false conclusion), allow for both strong and weak arguments. 
            That is, the second case does not allow for strong arguments. As we have just seen, any argument having this combination is necessarily weak. 
            In general, the basic idea of evaluating inductive argument, strength is not something that is determined by the actual truth or falsity of the premises and conclusion, but by the relationship between premises and conclusion</p></div>
        <h2>Induction and Cogency 
            </h2>
        <div class="kk"><p>Depending on their actual ability, (assuming that they already have actually accomplished their inferential claims by being strong), to accomplish their factual claims, inductive arguments can be either cogent or uncogent. 
            A cogent argument is an inductive argument that is strong and has all true premises. Both conditions must be met for an argument to be cogent, and if either is missing the argument is uncogent. 
            An inductive argument that does not actually accomplish its inferential claim, (that is not strong), cannot be cogent, regardless of the truth values of its premises. Such an inductive argument is uncogent, by definition. 
            Thus, an uncogent argument is an inductive argument that is either strong with one or more false premises, or weak, or both.   
            A cogent argument is the inductive analogue of a sound deductive argument and is what is meant by a “good‘‘ inductive argument without qualification. 
            Cogent  Argument = Strong Argument + All True Premises
            </p></div>
        <div class="kk"><p>There is a difference between sound and cogent arguments in regard to the true premise requirement. 
            In a sound argument, it is only necessary that the premises be true and nothing more. Given such premises and good reasoning, a true conclusion is guaranteed. 
            In a cogent argument, on the other hand, the premises must not only be true, they must also not ignore some important piece of evidence that outweighs the given evidence and entails a quite different conclusion. 
            That is, if the premises reflect all the important factors, then the argument is cogent; if not, then obviously the argument is not cogent.
