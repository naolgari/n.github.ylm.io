<div class="kk"><p>Request for a program or statement of a problem
    After a program requirement is received, phase 1 begins.
    In the real world, it is a complex task of extracting and documenting user                 requirements
    </p></div>
<div class="kk"><p>Step 1: Analyze the Problem
    Determine and understand the output items the program must produce 
    
    Determine the input items
    </p></div>
<div class="kk"><p>Step 2: Develop a Solution
    Select the exact set of steps, called 
        an “algorithm”, to solve the problem 
    Refine the algorithm 
    Start with initial solution in the analysis step until you have an acceptable and complete solution  
    Check solution

    </p></div>
<div class="kk"><p>Step 3: Code the Solution
    Consists of actually writing a C++ program <br> that corresponds to the solution developed in Step 2 
    Program should contain well-defined <br>        patterns or structures of the following types:  
    Sequence <br>
    Selection <br>
    Iteration  <br>
    Invocation <br>
    </p></div>
<div class="kk"><p>Step 3: Code the Solution
    Sequence: Defines the order in which         instructions are executed  
    Selection: Allows a choice between different operations, based on some condition 
    Iteration: Allows the same operation to be  repeated based on some condition 
    Also called looping or repetition   
    Invocation: Involves invoking a set of          statements when needed
    </p></div>
<div class="kk"><p>Step 4: Test and Correct the Program
    Testing: Method to verify correctness and     that requirements are met  
    Bug : A program error  
    Debugging : The process of locating an     error, and correcting and verifying              the correction 
    Testing may reveal errors, but does not      guarantee the absence of errors
    </p></div>
<div class="kk"><p>Five main documents are needed:

<div class="kk"><p>Ongoing correction of newly discovered bugs

<div class="kk"><p>Application software: Programs written to perform particular tasks for users 
    System software: Collection of programs to operate the computer system
    
    </p></div>
<div class="kk"><p>Operating system:  The set of system programs  used to operate and control a    computer 
    Tasks performed by the OS include: 
    Memory management 
    Allocation of CPU time 
    Control of input and output 
    Management of secondary storage devices
    </p></div>
<div class="kk"><p>Programming: Process of writing a       program, or software 
    Programming language  
    Set of instructions used to construct a   program 
    Comes in a variety of forms and types
    </p></div>
<div class="kk"><p>Low-level languages: Languages that    use instructions tied directly to one type of computer 
    machine language, assembly language  
    High-level languages: Instructions            resemble written languages, such as      English 
    Can be run on a variety of computer types 
    Visual Basic, C, C++, Java
    </p></div>
<div class="kk"><p>Machine language programs : only      programs that can actually be used to   operate a computer 
    Also referred to as object codes
    Consists of a sequence of instructions        composed of binary numbers  
    Contains two parts: an instruction and an addressAssembly language programs:            Substitute word-like symbols, such as    ADD, SUB, and MUL, for binary opcodes
    Use decimal numbers and labels for          memory addresses 
    One-to-one correspondence
    Usually, each line of assembly code produces     one machine instruction
    Example: ADD 1, 2  
    Assemblers: Translate programs into     machine language
    One-to-many correspondence
Each statement corresponds to several       machine language instructions
Much easier to program than in            assembly language.
Data  are referenced using descriptive   names
Operations can be described using        familiar symbols
Example:
			cost = price + tax
            Interpreted: Each statement is translated individually and executed immediately    after translation  
Compiled: All statements are translated and stored as an executable program, or object program; execution occurs later 
C++ is predominantly a compiled language


    
    
    </p></div>
<div class="kk"><p>The programs written in a high or          low-level language  
    It is written by the programmer.
    Can be compiled automatically into       object code or machine code or           executed by an interpreter. 
    C++ source programs have extension     ‘.cpp’ or ‘.,Translates high-level language to         machine language.
    Input to a compiler is the source code    
    Output from tCombines your object code with           pre-compiled object libraries for            input/output etc.
    Input are the object files (.obj).
    Output is the executable file (.exe) in     Windows.
    he compiler is                   the object  code (.obj).
    
    </p></div>
<div class="kk"><p>C++ actually adds an extra step to the   compilation process
    the code is run through a preprocessor,     which applies some modifications to the source code, before being fed to the compiler. 
         Eg. Removing comment <br>
         The purpose of most application          programs is to process data to produce  specific results
         C++ is immensely popular
         particularly for applications that require       speed and/or access to some low-level       features.
         It was created in 1979 by                     Bjarne Stroustrup
         at first as a set of extensions
         to the  C programming language. 
         You can write graphical programs  in      C++
it is much harder and less portable than text  based(console)programs.
We will be sticking to console programs in  this course. 
Everything in C++ is case sensitive:
someName is not the same as SomeName.

<div class="kk"><p>The following formula is used to              determine the heat transferred through a    flat substance, such as a wall, with its         two sides maintained at different               temperatures:
    q=−𝑘((𝑇_2−𝑇_1)/𝑑) q  is the heat transfer.
    k  is the thermal conductivity of the            substance in watts/m°C. 
    T2 is the higher temperature on one side of the substance in °C.
    T1 is the lower temperature on the other     side of the wall in °C.
    d  is the thickness of the substance in       meters.
    Determine the units of q 
by calculating the units resulting from the      right side of the formula.
A glass window
thickness of 0.5 centimeters, 
thermal conductivity of 0.77 watts/m°C, and 
outside and inside temperatures of 36.6°C &    22.2°, 
Determine the value of q.

    </p></div>
<div class="kk"><p>If you were asked to write a computer     program to determine the heat transfer    through a  substance, what inputs,       outputs, and algorithm would your       program  require?

    Step 1: Analyze the Problem
    The objective is to randomly generate an integer greater than or equal to 0 and less than 100. Then prompt the player (user) to guess the number. 
    Input: Guessed Number
    Output: Guess is Correct or Guess is Higher, or Guess is Lower
    Step 2: Develop a Solution
Accept guessed number from user
If the player guesses the number correctly, output an appropriate message. 
If the guessed number is less than the random number generated
display ‘‘guess is lower than the number. Guess again!’’; 
4. Otherwise
	display ‘‘guess is higher than the number. Guess again!’’; 

    </p></div>
<div class="kk"><p>Step 3: Then prompt the player to enter another number. 
    Step 4: The player is prompted to guess the random number until the player enters the correct number and stop after fixed no of trials .
